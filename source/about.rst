About
======
The importance of the travel book in developing the iconic literary and environmental associations of the English Lake District is widely recognized.
However, the extent to which the book ecology of the local English Lake District is informed by and linked to global geographic space is less well understood.
Additionally, the scale at which the Lake District “picturesque” way of framing nature as landscape itself travelled the world has been difficult to assess without access to large quantities of books and images as well as the means for analyzing them.

**Lake District Online** mobilizes new digital humanities methods and tools to address this knowledge gap by studying the global reaches of the Lake District through an interactive and fully searchable electronic bibliographic database and full text archive.
A unique feature of this project is that analysis of the Lake District takes place from outside – that is from a distant location in Vancouver, Canada, a former British colony located in the Pacific Northwest.
A larger aim of the analysis is to understand the global effects of the picturesque way of viewing the world that was first refined in this local region of England, a place that has long been celebrated as a site both of natural and cultural heritage.

The project is based on Simon Fraser University Library’s outstanding Lake District Collection of rare travel books, a corpus too large for study through traditional means, but small enough to function as a test case for future research on large data sets.

Objectives
===========
Based on the Simon Fraser University *Lake District Collection* of more than 250 rare books dating from 1709 – with its strengths in Lake District travel guides and its unique location in Vancouver, Canada – the larger objectives of the project are:

* to conduct an ecological study of the book within its cultural environment, analyzing the particular ways that ecology maps through time onto geographical space, both local and global;
* to study further impacts on the books’ very conditions of existence when migration also occurs between platforms, from print to digital;
* to prototype digital research tools and methods for use by other humanists working on other cultural materials from different periods.

Lake District
==============
Since the 1750s, English Lake District scenery has inspired writers and artists, and attracted legions of travelers and tourists. While the region is most famous for its associations with literary figures like William Wordsworth, John Ruskin, and Beatrix Potter, it has also been the site of repeated conflict over cultural heritage and environmental encroachment. In the late nineteenth century, the district came under the stewardship of the National Trust (est. 1895); in 1951, it was designated a national park; in the twenty-first century, a bid is underway for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site.


SFU Lake District Collection
=============================
SFU is home to one of the largest collections of rare books relating to the Lake District in the Northwest of England. The Lake District Collection (LDC) contains more than 250 illustrated first and rare editions dating from 1709, with a concentration in the nineteenth century. Of particular bibliographic interest are the LDC’s many period maps, excellent samples of engraving and illustration techniques and processes, including lithography, chromolithography and photography, as well as ornate bindings.

From its origins as a section of SFU Library’s Wordsworth Collection founded in 1973 by Jared Curtis (professor emeritus of SFU’s English Department and Coordinating Editor of the Cornell University Wordsworth Project), the LDC has grown steadily over the years to achieve a remarkable integrity and uniqueness. In 1989, Professor Mark L. Reed (U North Carolina), a renowned Wordsworth scholar, assessed SFU Library’s Wordsworth Collection and identified as one of its strengths late eighteenth and nineteenth-century guides, tours, and histories concerning the Lake District (Curtis 1999). In the early 2000s, the Library and a team of scholars created an annotated online bibliography of 99 selected books from the LDC.

Building on this pioneering digital humanities project, the **Lake District Online** aims to create a fully searchable, interactive digital archive of the entire LDC corpus,preserving searchable, high-resolution digital images and text files within a metadata framework designed to index, analyze, and visualize bibliographical, biographical, and historical information about the books as well as their contents.
