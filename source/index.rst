Welcome to Lake District Online's documentation!
================================================

**Lake District Online** is a bibliographic database and digital archive aimed at studying Book
Ecology and Migrating Collections in a global context. It collects information about books held in
*Special Collections and Rare Books* in Simon Fraser University’s W. A. C. Bennett Library.

The collection is organized by 3 categories: Book, People and Place. For instance, to explore the database by “Book,” select “Browse” at the top left-hand corner of the main page.
Select “Book” from the drop down menu. Doing so will direct you to the “Book List,” a table of books in the database.
The table shows preliminary information about each book in the database: title, author, imprint, edition, publication date. Only 25 entries are listed on each page; you can navigate between pages at the bottom of the table, either by selecting the page you wish to navigate to or by choosing the “Previous” and “Next” buttons.
